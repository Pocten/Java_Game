Launching the game: 
-To launch the game - launch the applications in the development environment.

Help the dog escape from the robots and run away from home. For this you need the key to the door that hides the robots. You have to kill all the robots to find the key. You do this with an ax and a banana, which restores your health units.

-Use the arrows on the keyboard to change the position of the dog.
-There are several robots on the map that will try to kill you. Avoid colliding with robots until you find and collect the ax on the map.
-If you already have an ax - attack the robots (just approach them and press the E key on the keyboard until the robot dies and disappears from the map)
-In the game menu (located at the top) you will find information about the map and your health. If your health drops, find fruits on the map that will restore health units.
-The moment you kill all the robots - a key will appear on the map.
-Open the door with the key and run out.
